# GM Engine

This project is my Graphics Programming and Game Engine Programming playground.
I'm using it to become a Graphics Programmer and to learn C++.

I'm writing the "renderer" in Vulkan in order to learn as much as possible about
the render pipeline and about what it takes to draw pixels onto a screen at a
reasonable frame rate.

## Credits and Aknowledgements

This project would not be possible without the amazing people who share their experience
with Vulkan and Graphics Programming through tutorials, books, video etc.

## Progress

The [data/screenshots](https://github.com/gmodarelli/gm/tree/master/data/shaders) folder contains screenshots for
every "milestone" I reach in my learning journey.

The first screenshot I took is the rendering of this simple [Cube](https://github.com/gmodarelli/gm/tree/master/data/screenshots/2019-01-23-1059.png)
which marks the moment I've managed to parse a glTF 2.0 asset and draw it on screen.
